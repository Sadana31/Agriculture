            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture has become a significant environmental concern. Excessive application of these chemicals can lead to water pollution, soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and adverse health effects.</p>
            <p>This website aims to raise awareness about the issue and provide potential solutions to reduce the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers in farming practices.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>By reducing the reliance on pesticides and fertilizers, we can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protect water resources from contamination</li>
                <li>Preserve soil quality and fertility</li>
                <li>Maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health</li>
                <li>Enhance human health and food safety</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>Implementing sustainable agricultural practices is key to addressing the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encouraging organic farming methods</li>
                <li>Promoting integrated pest management (IPM)</li>
                <li>Investing in research for alternative pest and weed control methods</li>
                <li>Educating farmers about proper application techniques and dosage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My solution will be a computer vision model that will monitor the amount of fertilizer</p>
            <p>and will also help find out if there is an overuse of fertilizer by using a sample of soil</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>How my solution works</h2>
            <p>My solution uses computer vision to analyze how much chemicals are being used and to regulate the use of persticides to have a good yield</p>
            <p>It will also contain a sample tester that will tell the farmer whether the soil is good to use or not using various checks like</p>
            <p>amount of water present, dryness of the soil, etc.</p>


            <h3>How my solution is different from others:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Makes use of modern-day methods like CV and AI</li>
                <li>Is cost-efficient and easily accessable</li>
                <li>Will alert the farmer in case of any mishappening</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Cost of the solution</h2>
            <p>The cost of building a model to regulate the use 
                of fertilizers can vary significantly depending on various 
                factors such as the complexity of the model, data requirements, 
                development time, and the expertise of the team involved. 
                Here are some potential cost considerations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data Collection and Analysis: The model would require extensive 
                    data on soil conditions, crop types, weather patterns, and fertilizer 
                    usage. Acquiring and analyzing this data can involve costs related to 
                    data collection, processing, and storage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Model Development: Building an effective model would involve the expertise of data 
                    scientists, agronomists, and software engineers. The cost would depend on the size 
                    and experience of the team, project duration, and complexity of the model algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Technology Infrastructure: Developing the model may require computing resources,
                    including servers, cloud services, and software licenses. The cost can 
                    vary depending on the scale of the project and the chosen infrastructure setup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is difficult to provide an exact cost estimate without specific project details. 
                    However, developing a robust model that regulates fertilizer use typically involves 
                    a significant investment of resources, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds 
                    of thousands or even millions of dollars. Collaboration with relevant stakeholders, 
                    partnerships, and funding opportunities can help offset some of these costs.
